            If you want to check out my telegram bot, please go to the link in the navagation bar, but please read <strong>HOW TO USE IT</strong> before proceeding.
            <br><br>
            <strong>PURPOSE</strong> To allow me to update my friends on Telegram while I am on vacation in China, despite it being blocked by China's "great firewall". 
            <br><br>
            <strong>HOW IT ACCOMPLISHES THIS</strong> It accomplishes this by sending information to a websocket, which acts as a median that can communicate freely with Telegram servers.
            <br><br>
            <strong>HOW TO USE IT</strong> I made a very simple 'password' program, to keep some of my friends from abusing the program, but the password is very simple to figure out, if you know how to inspect its element, hint hint. Feel free to test out my program, but please do not message anyone other than myself, or yourself, if you have a telegram account and know your chat_id. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>SOURCE CODE?</strong> Unfortunately, I do not have the source code available on my github account. You see most of it by inspecting element and using the url: <a href = "botsource.js">haodafan.com/botsource.js</a>
            <br><br>
            <strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong> The development process for this program took place in the week before I left for China. I originally hosted my website on Hostgator.com; however due to its lack of freedom, vps service, and node.js service, I needed to switch it to a different hosting service, digitalocean, which is much more developer-oriented and gave me much more freedom. The telgram bot api for Node.js was heavily used in the making of the bot. Quick shoutout to Edwin <a href = "https://edwinfinch.com">(edwinfinch.com)</a> for being a huge help with the backend programming of this project, and teaching me the basics of backend server programming and management. 
            <br><br>
            <strong> THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LOOK AT MY FUN LITTLE SIDE PROJECT :) IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS, PLEASE EMAIL ME AT haoda.fan(at)outlook(dot)com</strong> (Note that my 'contact me' email me might not work because I changed hosting services)
