        <p> Greetings. This is my first website. It's pretty great. I used CSS and HTML. I'm Haoda. Haoda the Great. Haoda the Amazing. Haoda the Asian. You know me right? I'm pretty much famous. My youtube channel has 4 subscribers. Please support my patreon and kickstarter and don't forget to follow me on myspace. </p>

            <h3> THE HEIRARCHY OF HEADINGS </h3>
            <h1 class = "king"> KING HEADING </h1>
            <p> Is married to his cousin to keep the bloodline pure. What could go wrong?</p>

            <h2> ITALIAN ITALIC NOBLEMEN HEADING </h2>
            <p> These italic italian blue-bloods sit on their piles of virtual gold pretending to do constructive things </p>

            <h3 class = "comic"> COMIC SANS HEADING </h3>
            <p> (Comic sans font is not working properly pls ignore)</p>

            <h4> MIDDLE CLASS HEADING </h4>
            <p> It's always shrinking/in danger for whatever reason</p>

            <h5> PEASANTS HEADING </h5>
            <p> He's the king? Well I didn't vote for him. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>

        <h3> Unordered list of historical misconceptions: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Vikings don't wear horned helmets</li>
            <li> Double bitted axes were rarely used in combat </li>
            <li> Russia was conquered during the winter before... by the Mongols</li>
            <li> Napoleon was not short. At the time, he was slightly above average. </li>
            <li> Christopher Columbus did not discover America. He discovered the caribbeans and the shore of Central America. </li>
            <li> Christopher Columbus did not prove the earth was round when everyone thought it was flat. He just thought the earth was smaller than everyone else did. And he was wrong.</li>
            <li> Christopher Columbus was not even the first european to set foot on the New World. Lief Erikson did that over 400 years ago. </li>
            <li> Christopher Columbus in general, is nothing like how school teaches him to be.</li>
            <li> Christopher Columbus also thought America was India, and that the natives were Indians. That's why we call them American Indians today. Thanks a lot, Columbus.</li>
            <li> Why do we celebrate Columbus day even</li>
