                <h1>First, a little about myself. </h1>
                <p>I am a second year student, studying for my Bachelor's of Computer Science (Honours, Co-op) at the University of Waterloo. </p>
                <p>I have been creating silly programs on the computer ever since I was little. It should be no surprise that I love CS and software development. </p>
                <p>In addition to CS, I also love art, music, and history.  </p>

                <h1>Some things I've been working on </h1>
                <h2> Web Projects </h2>
                <p>Please visit my <a href = "../webprojects/index.html">web projects</a> section to learn about some of the web applications I've worked on!</p>
                <h2>Other software projects </h2>
                <p>Unfortunately, since this website is still under development, I have not finished every section, so I will have to show off my software projects here.</p>
                <p><strong>Badgario - A ðŸ’© version of Agar.io</strong>:<br> This project is the closest I have come to making a finished, playable game. I made it as a side project during my first work term (Fall 2017)
                  as a way to learn the basics of game development. It plays exactly like Agar.io, the difference being that it is single player, and in order to win, you have to defeat a final boss.

                <p><strong>Vector Playground - Visualize vectors in 3d space!</strong><br> My grade 12 computer science final project. I, along with 3 other classmates (We called ourselves MagV Studios, haha),
                created an application using the Unity 3d Game Engine to visualize vectors in a 3 dimensional environment. We needed to cater our app to a specific client and his needs, which in this case, was our
                grade 12 Calculus teacher, Mr. Hyde.

                <h1>A bit about my personality and soft skills</h1>
                <p>I consider myself a fairly easy-going person. Many of the things I create are not created for the singular purpose of landing a job or advancing my career. They are mainly created
                for my own entertainment's sake (which I think is obvious if you look at the sort of things I put on here). </p>
                <p>
                  I am a very optimistic person who believes that anything can be framed positively, if one tries hard enough. I am very comfortable working in team and collaborative environments,
                  and I have a strong belief in the importance of welcoming new ideas and constructive criticism.
                </p>
                <p> I also consider myself a good communicator and an excellent public speaker. I have a great ability to express my ideas, thoughts, and concerns to others.</p>

                <h1>My Career Goals</h1>
                <p>As of right now, my career goals are rather unclear. Being in second year university, I'm still not really sure what kind of work I want to do for the rest of my life.
                  What is certain, is that I love creating things. I want to be able to make or be a part of making something cool that I can show off to my friends and family,
                  I don't believe the specifics of the industry (such as game development or web development) matters to me as much.</p>
