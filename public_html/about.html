                    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I am a second year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, currently on his first coop term working as a Software Developer on Cloud Platform
                            at the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I was born on January 14th 1998 (December 16th 1997 if you're asian), which makes my current age 19
                            (although I still look and feel like I'm 16 but that's besides the point, I can drink alcohol!).
                        </li>
                        <li>I have like a looooot of friends. Like so many friends. Like I can name like three off the top of my head. I'm not a loser. </li>
                        <li>I wear glasses. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="well well-lg">
                    <h3>So what are your hobbies?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> I play a lot of Dota 2 these days. And by play I mean lose. Okay, you got me, I am a loser.</li>
                        <li> I really love strategy games, like StarCraft, Civlization, and Paradox games. By the way, STARCRAFT REMASTERED IS OUT WOOHOO</li>
                        <li> I've been playing piano for almost a decade and a half but somehow I'm still mediocre. </li>
                        <li> I love doodling </li>
                        <li> I love coding </li>
                        <li> I love history </li>
                        <li> I love self-deprecating humor because it makes me feel good about being completely worthless</li>
                        <li> I love going on reddit on my spare time. And on not my spare time. Which is not good. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="well well-lg">
                    <h3>Hi, I am a hiring manager and I would like to know why I should hire you.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Oh no </li>
                        <li>
                            Forget the entire last section. I am super productive and never play videogames or go on reddit. I mean, what is reddit? I dont ever go on reddit,
                            the only reason I even know what it is is because I watched the CGPGrey video on it- not that I watch youtube videos of course. I code all day ery day and do
                            math problems in my spare time. Also I'm not a loser. I'm cool. But not in like a rebel kind of way in like a "hey I'd totally hire this guy" kind of way.
                        </li>
                        <li> What are you doing here? This is a really bad judgement on my character you should go check out my resume instead. Here, I'll even link it for you.
                          <a href = "/current-resume/Resume_2017-8-10.pdf">TADA!</a> </li>
                        <li> Don't keep reading. Go visit my <a href = "/webprojects">PROJECTS</a>. </li>
                        <li> (sweats nervously) </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="well well-lg">
                    <h3>Hi, I am an engineer who visited your steam profile and was wondering what your steam name even means.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Of course you don't know what it means, you dumb engineer, it's cause it's too pure for you. </li>
                        <li>
                            But if you must know, the statement "&#8707;!n&#8712;MMR | n>a &#8704;a&#8712;MMR, Pf: Me" translates to "There exists an MMR n, such that n is greater than a
                            for all possible a values (which are MMRs), and the proof of that is me."
                        </li>
                        <li> It means I have the largest possible MMR, silly. Now go back to pretending pi = e = 3 and using gradiants.</li>
