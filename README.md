Oh. Hi. Didn't see you there. Welcome to the github page of the HD REMASTERED EDITION of my website, [**haodafan.com**](http://haodafan.com)

# How to run this website on your own machine
I have absolutely no idea why you would ever want to do that, but i mean, to each their own I guess. It's simple, really. 
Just clone this repository like you would any other repository (click on the nice green button near the top-right of this page), and run any file from it! 

## Some notes on running my site
Most browsers like Google Chrome don't trust running some scripts locally, so if you open say index.html, the navbar, jumbotron or footer will NOT be displayed.

So how do you debug it? There are two ways of doing it. First is that you can just use safari lmao because safari doesn't have this security restriction so my webpages work fine if you open with it. 
The other way of doing it is to set up a local host server to run it from. It's not an amazingly complicated process to do but I'll show you how. 

## How to set up a super simple local host server with the best ever programming language - Python! 
I was about to make my own tutorial but il just link you to [an actual real tutorial that probably would explain it better than I ever could](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server).

# Wow your website is super intriguing and cool and all kinds of stuff, where can I learn more??????? 
Whoa don't get too excited there, Little Billy. If you want to learn more about the development of my website, visit my [WIKI PAGE](https://github.com/haodafan/haodafan.com-HD-Remastered/wiki)
